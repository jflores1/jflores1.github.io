Hi there!

I'm Jesse, the founder of [SuperWebPros](http://superwebpros.com) and [StartupLansing](http://startuplansing.org). I am passionate. I am purpose-driven. And, as a work-in-process Catholic, I am a pilgrim.

On this blog, I share my reflections on work, life, and faith.

On this page, I'll share with you a crash course on what to expect. To make things a little easier for you, here's a brief "table of contents":

## Why This Blog
**I believe that we are all pilgrims, and life is a sacred journey.**

I started this blog because I wanted to share my journey with you. More specifically, I have been consumed by a few burning questions over the tenure of my its-going-by-too-quickly-life:

* What does it take to be the best version of myself?
* How can I reconcile my worldly goals & ambitions with my spiritual ideals & convictions?
* How can I minimize the disruptions of failure and accelerate time to success?
* Is work/life balance even _really possible_, for driven people?

At the core of these questions is the tension I feel between 'who-I-am', 'who-I-want-to-be,' and 'who-I-ought-to-be.'

And I bet I'm not alone in feeling that tension.

In fact, I bet you feel that tension, too. It may be in the not-so-quiet of your heart or mind. 

At that moment when you wake up and feel tired, despite having slept an adequate amount.

At the moment you break a commitment to a friend or family, because 'something more important' has come up.

At that moment when your kid looks up at you, so proud of something they just did, and you realize you have no idea what they are talking about, because you were just checking an email or social media post as they were explaining it to you.

At the moment your head hits the pillow because you're exhausted, but your mind can't stop racing.

And I think this tension is particularly acute for people of faith, who also wrestle with the core question: '_What would you have me do, Lord?_'

So, on this blog, I explore those questions, I wrestle with that tension and, at the end of the day, it is my sincere hope that tensions are reconciled.

## What I Believe
When I was young (either before or after I attended Notre Dame, I'm not sure), I wrote the following "Mission Statement":

> I am a Catholic Christian who is dedicated to the service, teachings, work, and example of Jesus Christ and his Church. 
> I continually seek to do Godâ€™s will. 
> I am perpetually dedicated to the development of my mind, body, and spirit in an effort to become a more educated, capable, and free human being. 
> I am attuned to the great sense of poverty, injustice, oppression, and hopelessness that pains the lives of so many. Thus, I must constantly work to ease these burdens as my talents, gifts, and vocation afford me. 
> I recognize and acknowledge that what has been given to me has been given to me for the good of others. 
> I continually strive for excellence in my profession, as I understand it to be a vocation and thereby a means by which I may be most useful to God. 
> I strive to see the good in all people and welcome fruitful contact in any form, as I understand that our interactions with others serve to uplift, inspire, and facilitate growth. 
> I am grateful to those who have helped me to become who I am and to those who will help me to become who I will grow to be in the future. 
> I understand that people desire to love and to be loved and these desires culminate in the form of relationships. Thus, I strive to give all that I can to those people with whom I consider myself to have relationships with and to those people whose relationship with me is important to them.

For much of my adult life I have tried, with varied success, to live this mission. There have been times when I have profoundly missed the mark on one or more of these elements. And there are times when I feel like I am on the right path.

Still, it is my compass.

## My Background
I have been many things.

I grew up in Texas, outside of Houston. I really like Texas.

After high school, I attended the University of Notre Dame where I studied economics & theology. Had I been born 400 years earlier, I could have invented indulgences. Were I Protestant, I could found a mega-church.

Instead, I just often feel conflicted between God & mammon ;-)

After college, I spent two years teaching 7th, 9th, and 12th grade at [Bishop Dunne High School](https://www.bdcs.org/) in Dallas, Texas. It was easily one of the most challenging and rewarding things I've ever done.

I then spent several years as a member of the management team for a large industrial retailer in Atlanta, Georgia. I loved my friends there, who became like a family...especially since I didn't know anyone else in the city when I moved there.

I also earned my MBA from Emory University, while I was there.

In 2011, I left the company and started Fifth Room Storage. We were basically [MakeSpace](http://makespace.com), before MakeSpace was a thing.

Together with my co-founders, we participated in [Flashpoint](http://flashpoint.gatech.edu/), where we iterated ourselves out of a company.

It was a great learning experience.

In 2013, we moved to Lansing, Michigan, where I founded a software development company that subsequently evolved into [SuperWebPros](http://superwebpros.com), a company that builds & maintains websites for small businesses. 

It is a wonderful blend of my operations and business background from Atlanta & the software engineering background I acquired building custom web apps, which allows us to create real value for our customers.

Looking to help grow the startup ecosystem in Lansing, I also started [StartupLansing](http://startuplansing.org), a non-profit that helps to educate, connect, and celebrate startups & entrepreneurship in mid-Michigan.
