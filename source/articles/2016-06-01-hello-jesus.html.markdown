Ok, so it's probably not wise to start a new blog with a corny pun. Especially one that is probably only going to be funny to the very (very) select group of people who know something about computer programming and recognize that it's _impossible_ to start a new project without a ["Hello World"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) program...  

But, there's a wisdom in the programming concept, which is often used as a beginner's introduction and tutorial into a new language, framework, or project.

And that wisdom is this: to do something _really_ small and get feedback that what you're doing is working..._at least a little bit_. If you've started a project and gotten "hello world" to display on your monitor, you're doing something right.

Why not apply the same thing to our spiritual life and start really small?

Just take a moment, close your eyes, take a deep breath in and hold it for 5-10 seconds. 

Picture Jesus in your head. It can be Jesus on the cross, Jesus resurrected, Jesus in the Eucharist, or even 8lb, 6oz baby Jesus - doesn't matter. Just picture Jesus.

Now, with your eyes still closed, exhale slowly, over 10-15 seconds and, as you do so, just say "Hello, Jesus."

And smile.

See - that was breezy, right?

Now, do that 4 or 5 more times.

Feels pretty good, huh?

## A Note for the Over-Churched

Now, if you're like me, that is to say over-churched and theologically "over"-educated, this was probably a disappointing post.

Sorry not sorry. 

I know for me, at least, I can get so caught up in ideas and philosophies, dogmas and doctrines that I forget _the person_ who rests in the center of it all: Jesus. 

And I know that I often forget that what he wants more than my knowledge _is my heart_. 

And that, he only gets, when I remember to call him and just say "hello."
